# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This notebook demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation on the Mall Customers dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Steps:

1.  **Importing the Dependencies:** Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.
2.  **Data Collection & Analysis:** Load the dataset and perform initial data analysis, including checking for missing values and understanding the data structure.
3.  **Choosing Features:** Select the relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score) for clustering.
4.  **Selecting the Number of Clusters:** Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method (WCSS) and Silhouette Score.
5.  **Training the K-Means Clustering Model:** Train the K-Means model with the optimal number of clusters.
6.  **Visualizing the Clusters:** Visualize the clusters and their centroids to understand the customer segments.
7.  **Evaluating clusters using Silhouette Score:** Evaluate the clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.
